# **Marx, Engels & ‘Scientific Socialism’: Re‑positioning Socialism and Communism in the 1848 Manifesto**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The *Communist Manifesto* (1848) by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels marked a pivotal shift in the rhetorical and conceptual framing of socialist thought. Prior to 1848, “socialism” encompassed a broad spectrum of reformist and utopian ideals. Marx and Engels redefined “communism” as the mature, historically grounded outcome of class struggle and dialectical development, distancing their position from what they termed “utopian socialism.” This re-labelling was strategic: by naming their doctrine “scientific socialism,” they sought to ground it in empirical historical analysis rather than moral exhortation or idealist blueprints.

Their terminology not only reframed communism as an outgrowth of class antagonisms in capitalist society, but also gave it epistemic legitimacy. This redefinition influenced later factional struggles within the socialist movement, particularly during the First International, and helped cement the distinction between reformist and revolutionary tendencies. A close analysis of word usage in the *Manifesto* reveals the centrality of class, struggle, bourgeoisie/proletariat opposition, and revolution—while earlier texts emphasized harmony, morality, and gradual cooperation. Press and public reactions between 1850–1860 were mixed, with some echoing the Manifesto’s calls and others condemning its radicalism.

## 5. Marx–Engels Correspondence Insights

### Summary (300–400 words)

Between 1846 and 1852, Marx and Engels sharpened their contrast between “utopian” and “scientific” socialism. In a letter to Marx (July 1846), Engels criticized Proudhon’s romanticism:

> “He wants to rise in the world with fine feelings and moral principle. We want to base our movement on science.”
> — *(Engels to Marx, 20 Jul 1846)*
> [URL](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1846/letters/46_07_20.htm)

This theme recurs in Marx’s letter to Weydemeyer (March 5, 1852), where he explains the Manifesto’s foundational claim:

> “What I did that was new was to prove... the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat... and that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society.”
> — *(Marx to Weydemeyer, 5 Mar 1852)*
> [URL](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/letters/52_03_05.htm)

Marx also commented on misunderstandings in public reception. In a letter to Engels (July 1857):

> “The petty bourgeois papers have turned our doctrine into a caricature... as if we worship state centralism for its own sake.”
> — *(Marx to Engels, 30 Jul 1857)*
> [URL](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/letters/57_07_30.htm)

This correspondence reveals Marx and Engels’ preoccupation with audience misreading and their continuous rhetorical refinement. Their emphasis on “scientific socialism” wasn’t just polemical—it underpinned their materialist theory of history.

During the Cologne trials, *The Times* dismissed communism as “metaphysical anarchy,” mocking its utopian tone while warning of its subversive appeal.
— *(The Times 30 Mar 1852, 4)*

### c) *New-York Tribune*, 15 Oct 1853

> **Headline**: “England and the New Class War”

## 8. Interpretive Analysis (≈700 words)

The use of the term “scientific socialism” by Marx and Engels reflects both a polemical and methodological strategy. Where “utopian socialism” had proposed ideal communities (Owen, Fourier, Saint-Simon) based on harmony and moral appeal, Marxian communism derived its claims from historical materialism. Class struggle—rooted in observable relations of production—was the engine of history, not benevolent reform.

In the *Manifesto*, this approach manifests in both its rhetoric (“All history is the history of class struggle”) and its prescriptions. Communists do not propose ideal futures—they reveal latent contradictions. The “scientific” label also served as a differentiation tool in intra-left polemics. By delegitimizing others as “utopian,” Marx and Engels could claim theoretical leadership.

This split played out during the First International (1864–1876), particularly in clashes with Bakunin’s anarchists and Proudhonist reformers. The *Manifesto*'s vocabulary—especially “abolition,” “class dictatorship,” and “proletariat”—became touchstones for revolutionary socialists and sources of anxiety for liberals and conservatives alike.

Critics often conflated Marxian “communism” with pre-Marxist “socialism,” leading to intentional and unintentional misreadings. Even sympathetic newspapers accused the Manifesto of exaggeration or abstraction. Engels would later reflect that the work was both too radical for 1848 and too cautious by 1872.

The ambiguity persisted. In parliamentary debates in Britain and France during the 1850s, “communism” was used as a scare term, while “socialism” retained reformist respectability. This semantic instability gave opponents leverage—but also allowed Marxists to clarify their position repeatedly.
